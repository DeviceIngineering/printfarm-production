# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY - PrintFarm v7.0 with Reserve Hotfix

## ✅ PRODUCTION HOTFIX STATUS: COMPLETED

### 🎯 Critical Issue Resolved:
- **Problem**: Products with reserve stock were missing from "Production List"
- **Impact**: 8,300 units of reserve inventory (5 products) were invisible to production planning
- **Solution**: Updated API filters and business logic to include products with reserve
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY TESTED AND WORKING

### 📊 Verified Results:
```
Products with reserve now in production planning:
1. 15-43001R: 800 units reserve → 800 units production
2. 263-41522: 500 units reserve → 500 units production  
3. 556-51448: 1000 units reserve → 1000 units production
4. N321-12: 1000 units reserve → 1000 units production
5. N421-11-45K: 5000 units reserve → 5000 units production

TOTAL RECOVERED: 8,300 units back in production planning
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes:
### Files Modified:
- `backend/apps/api/v1/tochka_views.py` - Updated filters for reserve inclusion
- `backend/apps/products/models.py` - Enhanced production_needed calculation  
- `frontend/src/pages/TochkaPage.tsx` - Fixed toFixed error, added Reserve columns
- `backend/test_reserve_production_hotfix.py` - Critical tests for validation

### Key Business Rules Implemented:
1. **Products with reserve are ALWAYS included in production planning**
2. **production_needed = max(reserved_stock, standard_calculation)**
3. **Reserve column shows reserve_minus_stock when enabled**
4. **Visual highlighting for products with reserve in UI**

## 🧪 Test Coverage:
- ✅ **Critical hotfix tests**: 100% passing
- ✅ **API endpoints**: All returning correct data
- ✅ **Edge cases**: Tested with varying reserve amounts
- ✅ **Integration**: Frontend + Backend working together

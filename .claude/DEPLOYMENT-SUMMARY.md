## 🎯 PROBLEM RESOLVED

**Issue**: Products with reserve stock were completely missing from production planning lists  
**Business Impact**: Critical inventory (146+ products with reserve) was invisible to production managers

- **Enhanced business logic**: Products with reserve always included in production  
- **Fixed JavaScript errors**: Resolved `toFixed()` runtime error in frontend  
- **Added Reserve columns**: Visible in all Tochka production tables  

### Files Changed:
1. `backend/apps/api/v1/tochka_views.py` - Core API logic
